# #4. Welcome DevKitV1!

**8^th^ January, 2019**

------

To overcome the hassle I had gone through, about the hardware with the last one, we have now switched to ESP32 DevKitV1, which features a microUSB port attached to CP2102 USB-to-Serial converter. This has been done to eliminate the chances of failure due to improper hardware setup. Now, all it takes to program it is to plug in the device and flash the app. 

## Hello World!

I flashed the `blink` example on this board and I initially had troubles with the serial port via WSL. The problem got fixed after I installed the required drivers manually into the system. This board sports an on-board LED routed to GPIO2. Blinks Blue!

## Encoder Test

I have been wanting to test the high resolution encoder using a pulse counter module. using the pulse counter module, you can count the RISING/FALLING edges without having to bother interrupting the main task. 

For testing it out, I have made the hardware connections and written basic code that arms the counter, queries the count and prints it out every 500ms. 

- [x] The test has been a success, although it took longer than expected. 

The observations have been summarized in the individual test folder.s
