# 1. My Beginnings

It has been a crazy journey for me with the ESP32 development board, being a semi-noob. I have had decent experience with Arduino and other basic electronics revolving around it. I was also extremely fascinated about general happenings around microcontrollers and single-board-computers and that's when I learnt about ESP32. Although I got to know about it as early as 2016, I was busy poking my nose around CAD and manufacturing. Finally, in late 2018, I got to use ESP32 as a part of my project and I am just loving it! It has consumed a bit of time setting up the entire hardware-software setup but I intend to cover those aspects as well, in order to make it smooth for you. 

### What can you do with an ESP32?

ESP32 is a fun little microcontroller chip that's far more powerful than a typical Arduino and can be used to make your fancy DIY electronics projects work. I was using it to build a controller for a biped robot, a research project I had taken up at IIT Bombay. To give you a broad understanding of my requirements, check the illustration below.
